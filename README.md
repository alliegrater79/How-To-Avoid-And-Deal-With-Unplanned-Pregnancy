# How-To-Avoid-And-Deal-With-Unplanned-Pregnancy
Finding out you're pregnant unexpectedly might be upsetting, but it's a regular occurrence. Did you know that half of all pregnancies are unplanned? It is normal for many women to be concerned about how to deal with an unforeseen pregnancy. It is critical, like with any major choice, to give yourself time to analyze, accept, and determine what to do next. <br>

A choice concerning an unwanted pregnancy is a personal one. Accurate information and assistance are beneficial, but only you know what is best for you.<br>

Pregnant women have three options:<br>

•	Parenting: Parenting is both giving births and raising a kid.<br>

•	Abortion is the use of drugs or a medical procedure to stop a pregnancy.<br>

•	Adoption is giving birth and permanently putting your kid with another individual or family.<br>

It is sometimes simple to decide what to do with an unplanned premarital pregnancy. It might be challenging or tricky at times. Your choice is highly personal, and everyone's situation is unique. Because you are the only person walking in your shoes, the decision is entirely yours.<br>

How To Deal With Unplanned Pregnancy<br>

Here are a few steps that can help you cope with a premarital pregnancy:<br>

1.	Consider the many options.<br>
Move through your fear and imagine all of your possibilities. Consider yourself at home with your child. Consider grocery shopping and other daily activities.<br>

What feelings do you expect to feel a week after the abortion, a month later, when you hold your first child? Can you see yourself going through the adoption procedure if you're thinking about it? How would you react to that? Each of these choices is tough in its own way. Contacting a trained options counsellor may assist you in navigating the process of teenage pregnancy.<br>

2.	Recognize that you are in shock and that this is normal.<br>
Unplanned premarital pregnancy is terrifying. It is not something you expected, planned for, or even considered. It may take a few days for you to accept it, which is fine. Allow yourself time to process and absorb everything.<br>

3.	Allow Yourself to Feel Emotions<br>
Allow yourself to experience all of your feelings, including rage, exhilaration, irritation, and perplexity. Write down your emotions so that when the intensity has lessened, you can go over them and find out how you still feel about the pregnancy.<br>

4.	Confront Your Doubts<br>
Most women have questions about themselves and their capacity to make a safe pregnancy decision, whether their pregnancies are planned or unplanned. It is easy to allow your concerns and uncertainties to overwhelm you, but it is critical to recognize that those first sentiments are insufficient to make your choice. Recognize your emotions, but don't let fear decide your decision for you. Remember that you are not required to make a decision right immediately. First, you need to know how to deal with unplanned pregnancy.<br>

How to Avoid Unwanted Pregnancy<br>
We all dislike unpleasant shocks, especially ones that threaten to interrupt our lives. Unwanted pregnancies rank high on this list of unpleasant surprises. Take the following steps to avoid unplanned teenage pregnancy:<br>

•	If you are still in your teens, avoid penetrative intercourse. Wait until you are capable of bearing the duty maturely.<br>
•	If you intend to become sexually active, be prepared with all available contraceptive methods. Make sure your spouse wears a condom or takes birth control tablets every time you have sex.<br>
•	If you are unclear about the birth-control techniques you are using, take an emergency contraceptive.<br>
